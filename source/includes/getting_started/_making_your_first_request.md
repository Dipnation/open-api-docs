In this demo , I use [https://api-sandbox.tiki.vn/integration/v1/categories](https://api-sandbox.tiki.vn/integration/v1/categories) to get available categories list in TIKI. You can have a look at API docs here for detail.

1. Use http method GET with URL : [https://api-sandbox.tiki.vn/integration/v1/categories](https://api-sandbox.tiki.vn/integration/v1/categories) 
2. Add header tiki-api with your token value get from [here](#authentication).
3. Click Send
