# Making your first request

Once you read and understand our [authentication](#authentication) , you can try to call a "hello world" request.

In this example I'm going to use [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/) to create request , you can use it as well

In this demo , I use [https://api-sandbox.tiki.vn/integration/v1/categories](https://api-sandbox.tiki.vn/integration/v1/categories) to get list available categories in TIKI. You can have a look at API docs here for detail.

1. Use http method GET with URL : [https://api-sandbox.tiki.vn/integration/v1/categories](https://api-sandbox.tiki.vn/integration/v1/categories) 
2. Don't forget add header tiki-api with value is your token get from [here](#authentication).
3. Done , click Send 

â†’ If your response look like this then  ** Congratulations ** you just moved a first step into Tiki integration system :D
